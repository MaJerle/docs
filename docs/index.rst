Welcome to documentation!
=========================

Welcome to documentation for software written by Tilen MAJERLE.
This is an entry point for all the projects which I'm working on now and in the future.

.. note:: 
    There is a heavy work to be done to transfer all documentation written in doxygen to sphinx.
